## Description

This project can be found in [TheOdinProject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). Its difficult level has forced me into being more organized, research deeper and apply some new techniques and features in order to achieve the expected page looking. 

This time the markup has a particular focus on precisely describing what the content is, by using html5 tags such as `<section>`, `<head>`, `<article>` and `<main>`. Their use, for instance, help the engine search bots to go through the content and understand what bits of information they should retrive (depending what is the user searching for). Another great advantage that comes with writing semantic markup is that browsers and screen readers can easily render the pages as they meant to be.

Also, this time, I took extra care with my "_html_" and "_css_" files making sure that there weren't repeating lines of code throught. I have implemented the so-called D.R.Y (Don't Reapt Yourself) technique. Plus, I used  porper indentation and meaningful comments to improve code readability, and understanding, for when my "future" self or other developers are refering to it. 

Very important too is to highlight the fact that consulting documentation such as **MDN** - Modzilla Developer Networking, **CSS-tricks** and **Stack-Overflow** not only has helped me finding the solutions to problems I'd encounter along the building process, but it also has enabled me to have more control over the layout and the elements that make up the page, and have reached the desirable looking. _Box-Shadow, _Tool-tips_, _:Before_ and _:After_ are some of the many properties I have come to know and master in the end of the project. 

To conclude. I have truly enjoyed my trip to _Google-results-project_. I went with an empty bag and cameback with it full. Being better at searching for solutions, naming and using classes (including pseudo elements/classes), controlling page layout and design (with _flex-box_ or _position_, for instance) or using comments are some of the experiences and tools that are now inside my bag to be used for future projects. See you next time!
